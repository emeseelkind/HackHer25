# HackHer25 - NutriByte

Emese Elkind and Shrinidhi Krishnan

**Description:** 

**NutriByte** is an AI-Powered Nutrition Tracker that calculates your total nutrition intake per day based off of the food you input. 
The food input is processed by the **Deep Learning** model which outputs the nutritional facts into the website!
You can set personal daily **goals** that you can try to achieve by eating well and you can connect with friends and send them positive quotes and stickers!
The Deep Learning model was trained with data from the kaggle website. Download csv from here:

We used React JS to make our NutriByte website.

Clone this github onto your computer and in the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```

This runs the app in the development mode.
