1. AI-Powered Skin Cancer Detector
Description: Train a CNN model (using a dataset like ISIC) to classify images of skin lesions as benign or malignant.
UI Features: Users can upload an image of a skin lesion, and the model provides a diagnosis with a confidence score.
Bonus: Provide heatmaps for explainability using Grad-CAM.


2. AI-Powered ECG Anomaly Detector
Description: Train a LSTM model to detect arrhythmias in ECG data.
UI Features: Users can upload ECG signal data, and the model detects irregularities.
Bonus: Implement real-time monitoring if connected to a live ECG feed.


üìå Project Name: AI-Powered Protein Tracker
üîπ Goal: A deep learning-powered tool that helps users track their daily protein intake based on food inputs.

1. UI for User Input (Web or Desktop App)
Users enter the food they‚Äôve eaten (e.g., ‚Äú2 eggs, 100g chicken, 1 cup lentils‚Äù).
Optional: Upload an image of their meal for image-based recognition (advanced feature).
2. Deep Learning Model (Using Scikit-Learn & NLP)
Text-based protein estimation:
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process user input and extract food names.
Match the input with a prebuilt food nutrition database (USDA Food Database, MyFitnessPal API, or your own CSV dataset).
Calculate total protein intake per meal and per day.
Image-based food recognition (Advanced Option):
Use a CNN model (like MobileNet or EfficientNet) trained on a food dataset to detect food items and estimate protein content.
3. Protein Recommendation System
Suggests daily protein goals based on user profile (age, weight, fitness goals, etc.).
Gives warnings if protein intake is too low or too high.
Provides dietary suggestions (e.g., ‚ÄúTry adding Greek yogurt for more protein!‚Äù).
4. Data Visualization & Tracking
Show a progress bar for daily protein intake.
